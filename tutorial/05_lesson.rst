Lesson 5 - Default Navigation
=============================

Goal
----

In this lesson we'll use the ``check_availability`` operation in our
flow and use the results it returns.

Get Started
-----------

Let's go back to **new\_hire.sl** and add in the plumbing to run our new
operation.

Inputs
------

First, we'll add an inputs section to our flow between the name and the
workflow. It works the same way as inputs to an operation.

.. code:: yaml

      inputs:
        - address

New Task
--------

Now we can add a new task to our flow. We'll add it right after the
``print_start`` task and call it ``check_address``.

.. code:: yaml

        - check_address:
            do:
              check_availability:
                - address
            publish:
              - availability: available

First note that in the ``check_address`` task, the ``address`` input
name is not given a default value, as the ``text`` input is given in the
``print_start`` task. It's not necessary here because the ``address``
input name in the ``check_availability`` operation matches the
``address`` input name in the flow. The value input to the flow will get
passed to the operation input with the same name.

Publish
-------

Also notice that we've added the ``publish`` section to this task. This
is the spot where we publish the outputs returned from the operation to
the flow's scope. In our case, the ``check_availability`` operation
returns an output named ``available`` and we publish it to the flow's
scope under the name ``availability``. We'll use the ``availability``
variable momentarily in an input expression in another of the flow's
tasks.

Input Expression
----------------

We'll add one more task to our flow for now to demonstrate the default
navigation behavior. This new task calls the ``print`` operation again
to print out whether the email address that was provided is available.
We pass a string which contains a Python expression to the ``text``
input. Note that we are using the published output from the previous
task along with some of the flow input variables in the expression.

.. code:: yaml

        - print_finish:
            do:
              base.print:
                - text: "'Availability for address ' + address + ' is: ' + str(availability)"

Once again take note of the quoting that is necessary. The double quotes
(") encompass a Python expression which uses single quotes (') for its
string literals and no additional quotes for the variable names.

Run It
------

Let's save our files and run the flow and see what happens based on the
output and results of the ``generate_user_mail`` operation. Once again,
make sure to run it a few times so we can see what happens when the
operation returns a result of ``SUCCESS`` and what happens when the
result is ``FAILURE``.

.. code:: bash

    run --f <folder path>/tutorials/hiring/new_hire.sl --cp <folder path>/tutorials/base,<folder path>/tutorials/hiring --i address=john.doe@somecompany.com

When the check\_availability operation returns a result of ``SUCCESS``
the flow continues with the next task and prints out the availability
message. However, when the check\_availability operation returns a
result of ``FAILURE`` the flow ends immediately with a result of
``FAILURE``. This is the default navigation behavior.

Note that operations which don't explicitly return any results always
return the result ``SUCCESS``.

Up Next
-------

In the next lesson we'll see one way to handle ``FAILURE`` results.

New Code - Complete
-------------------

**new\_hire.sl**

.. code:: yaml

    namespace: tutorials.hiring

    imports:
      base: tutorials.base

    flow:
      name: new_hire

      inputs:
        - address

      workflow:
        - print_start:
            do:
              base.print:
                - text: "'Starting new hire process'"

        - check_address:
            do:
              check_availability:
                - address
            publish:
              - availability: available

        - print_finish:
            do:
              base.print:
                - text: "'Availability for address ' + address + ' is: ' + str(availability)"
