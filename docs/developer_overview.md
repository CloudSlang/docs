What follows is a brief overview of how CloudSlang and the CloudSlang Orchestration Engine (Score) work. For more detailed information see the [Score API](developer_score.md#score-api) and [Slang API](developer_cloudslang.md#slang-api) sections.

The CloudSlang Orchestration Engine is an engine that runs workflows. Internally, the workflows are represented as [ExecutionPlans](developer_score.md#executionplan). An [ExecutionPlan](developer_score.md#executionplan) is essentially a map of IDs and [ExecutionSteps](developer_score.md#executionstep). Each [ExecutionStep](developer_score.md#executionstep) contains information for calling an action method and a navigation method. 

When an [ExecutionPlan](developer_score.md#executionplan) is triggered it executes the first [ExecutionStep's](developer_score.md#executionstep) action method and navigation method. The navigation method returns the ID of the next [ExecutionStep](developer_score.md#executionstep) to run. Execution continues in this manner, successively calling the next [ExecutionStep's](developer_score.md#executionstep) action and navigation methods, until a navigation method returns `null` to indicate the end of the flow.

CloudSlang plugs into the CloudSlang Orchestration Engine (Score) by compiling its workflow and operation files into Score [ExecutionPlans](developer_score.md#executionplan) and then triggering them. Generally, when working with CloudSlang content, all interaction with Score goes through the [Slang API](developer_cloudslang.md#slang-api), not the [Score API](developer_score.md#score-api).
