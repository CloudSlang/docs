It's easy to get started running CloudSlang flows, especially using the CLI and ready-made content.

+ [Download](http://cloudslang.io/download) the CLI zip file. 
+ Unzip the archive.
+ Run the CloudSlang executable. 
+ At the prompt enter: 
  
```bash
run --f ../content/io/cloudslang/base/print/print_text.sl --i text=Hi
```

+ The CLI will run the ready-made `print_text` operation that will print the value passed to the variable `text` to the screen.
