#Lesson 4 - Outputs and Results

##Goal
In this lesson we'll write a bit of a more complex operation that returns an output and results.

##Get Started
Let's create a new file in the **tutorials/hiring** folder named **check\_availability.sl** in which we'll house an operation to check whether a given email address is available.

We'll also start off our new operation in much the same way we did with the print operation. We'll put in a `namespace`, the `operation` key, the name of the operation and an input.

```yaml
namespace: tutorials.hiring

operation:
  name: check_availability

  inputs:
    - address
```

##Action
This time we'll have a little more of a complex action. The idea here is to simulate checking the availability of the given address. We'll import and use the Python random module to get a random number between 0 and 2. If the random number we get is 0 we'll say the requested email address is already taken.

We've added a commented out line, using a Python comment (#) to print the random number that was generated. We can uncomment this line during testing to see that our operation is working as expected.

```yaml
  action:
    python_script: |
      import random
      rand = random.randint(0, 2)
      vacant = rand != 0
      #print rand
```

>YAML Note: Since we're writing a multi-line Python script here we use the pipe (|) character to denote the usage of literal style block notation where all newlines will be preserved.

##Outputs
In the outputs section we put any information we want to send back to the calling flow. In our case, we want to return whether the requested address was already taken. The outputs are a list of key:value pairs where the key is the name of the output and the value the expression to be returned. In our case, we'll just return the value in the `vacant` variable.

```yaml
  outputs:
    - available: vacant
``` 

##Results
The last section of our operation defines the results we return to the calling flow. The results are used by the navigation of the calling flow. We'll start by using the default result values, `SUCCESS` and `FAILURE`. If the email address was available, we'll return a result of `SUCCESS`, otherwise we'll return a result of `FAILURE`. When the operation is run, the first result whose expression is true or empty is returned. It is therefore important to take care in the ordering of the results.

```yaml
  results:
    - FAILURE: rand == 0
    - SUCCESS
```

##Run It
Let's save and run this operation by itself before we start using it in our flow to make sure everything is working properly. (You might want to uncomment the line that prints out the random number while testing.) To run the operation, enter the following in the CLI:

```bash
run --f <folder path>/tutorials/hiring/check_availability.sl --i address=john.doe@somecompany.com
``` 

Run the operation a few times and make sure that both the `SUCCESS` and `FAILURE` cases are working as expected. 

##Up Next
In the next lesson we'll integrate our new operation into our flow, using the output and results it sends.

##New Code - Complete

**check\_availability.sl**
```yaml
namespace: tutorials.hiring

operation:
  name: check_availability

  inputs:
    - address

  action:
    python_script: |
      import random
      rand = random.randint(0, 2)
      vacant = rand != 0
      #print rand

  outputs:
    - available: vacant

  results:
    - FAILURE: rand == 0
    - SUCCESS
```
