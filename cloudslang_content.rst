Ready-made CloudSlang content is hosted on GitHub in the
`cloud-slang-content <https://github.com/CloudSlang/cloud-slang-content>`__
repository. The repository contains CloudSlang content written by the CloudSlang
team as well as content contributed by the community.

The cloud-slang-content repository contains ready-made CloudSlang flows and
operations for many common tasks as well as content that integrates with several
other systems.

The repository may contain some beta content. Beta content is not verified or
tested by the CloudSlang team. Beta content is named with the ``beta_`` prefix.
The community is encouraged to assist in setting up testing environments for the
beta content.

For more information on the content contained in the repository, see the
`docs <https://github.com/CloudSlang/cloud-slang-content/blob/master/DOCS.md>`__
page.

Running CloudSlang Content
==========================

The simplest way to get started running ready-made CloudSlang content is to
download and run the pre-packaged cslang-cli-with-content file as described in
the :doc:`Get Started <get_started>` section.

Alternatively, you can build the CLI from source and download the content
separately. To build the CLI yourself and for more information on using the CLI,
see the :doc:`CLI <cloudslang_cli>` section.

**Note:** When using a locally built CLI you may need to include a classpath to
properly reference ready-made content. For information on using classpaths, see
:ref:`Run with Dependencies <run_with_dependencies>`.

Contributing Content
====================

We welcome and encourage community contributions to CloudSlang. Please see the
:doc:`contribution <developer_contribution>` section to familiarize yourself
with the Contribution Guidelines and `Project Roadmap
<https://github.com/CloudSlang/cloud-slang/wiki/Project-Roadmap>`__
