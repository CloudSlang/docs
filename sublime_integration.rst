Sublime Integration
+++++++++++++++++++

Although CloudSlang files can be composed in any text editor, using a
modern code editor with support for YAML syntax highlighting is
recommended.

To ease the CloudSlang coding process you can use our Sublime Text
snippets.

Download, Install and Configure Sublime
=======================================

1. Download and install `Sublime Text <http://www.sublimetext.com/>`__.
2. Download the `slang-sublime
   package <https://github.com/orius123/slang-sublime/releases/tag/0.1.1>`__.
3. Copy the downloaded package file into
   C:\\Users<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sublime Text 2\\Installed Packages
4. Restart Sublime Text.
5. New files with the **.sl** extension will be recognized as CloudSlang
   files. For existing files you may have to change the language
   manually.

To use the templates start typing the template name and press enter when
it appears on the screen.

The following templates are provided:

+------------+--------------------------------+
| Keyword    | Description                    |
+============+================================+
| cloudslang | template for a CloudSlang file |
+------------+--------------------------------+
| flow       | template for a flow task       |
+------------+--------------------------------+
| task       | template for a task operation  |
+------------+--------------------------------+
| operation  | template for an operation      |
+------------+--------------------------------+

**Note:** Optional CloudSlang elements are marked as comments (begin
with ``#``).
